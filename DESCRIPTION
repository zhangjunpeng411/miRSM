Description: The package aims to identify miRNA sponge modules by integrating expression data and miRNA-target binding information.
    It provides several functions to study miRNA sponge modules, including popular methods for inferring gene modules 
    (candidate miRNA sponge modules), and a function to identify miRNA sponge modules, as well as a function to conduct 
    functional analysis of miRNA sponge modules.
